;;; Commentary:

;; direnv <http://direnv.net/> is an environment switcher for the shell.  Users
;; define a .envrc file in their directories, and when they change into those
;; directories,  direnv loads those environment variables.  When they change
;; out, direnv unloads them.
;;
;; This is particularly useful for defining project-specific environment
;; variables.
;;
;; This module integrates direnv with Emacs.
;;
;; The main function is 'direnv-load-environment', which exports the
;; environment difference from direnv and sets in globally within Emacs,
;; making the direnv environment settings available to any subprocess.  When
;; you change to a different buffer, the environment variable changes are
;; reverted, thanks to the magic of direnv.
;;
;; One way to use this is as a hook in find-file and buffer-list-update-hook:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'direnv-load-environment)
;;    (add-hook 'buffer-list-update-hook 'direnv-load-environment)

;;; Code:

(require 'json)

(defvar direnv--loading nil
  "True if direnv is in the middle of loading environment variables.")

(defun direnv--call-json-process (program &rest args)
  "Execute PROGRAM with ARGS, parsing stdout as JSON."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (let ((status (apply 'call-process program nil '(t nil) nil args)))
      (unless (eq status 0)
        (error "%s exited with status %s" program status))
      (if (= 0 (buffer-size))
          nil
        (progn
          (goto-char (point-min))
          (json-read))))))

(defun direnv-export (directory)
  "Export direnv settings in DIRECTORY as list of pairs.
Pairs are (var-name . var-value)"
  (let ((default-directory directory))

e.g.
